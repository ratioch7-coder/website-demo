  <h3>Legal (Civil) Ceremonies</h3>
  <p>
  A legal ceremony in Ghana, often referred to as Marriage of Ordinance, is a legally binding marriage recognized worldwide. This type of ceremony is conducted by a judge or an officiant authorized by the Ghanaian government. Civil ceremonies are not a common choice for a destination wedding because of the legal requirements associated with it. 
  </p>
  Requirements for a Legal Ceremony in Ghana:
<ul>
  <li>Health certificate and blood tests: These have to be performed in Mexico, NOT back home.</li>
  <li>In some destinations chest X-Rays are required (to rule out tuberculosis). These are to be taken a few days before the wedding in Ghana.</li>
  <li>The wedding couple must arrive 4 full business days in advance of the wedding (arrival day, Ghanaian holidays and weekends do not count).</li>
  <li>Four witnesses over 18 years old.</li>
  <li>Couples and witnesses passports must be valid for at least 6 months.</li>
  <li>Couple and witnesses must obtain tourist cards provided by customs when you arrive in Ghana.</li>

<h3>CUSTOMARY (SYMBOLIC) CEREMONY</h3>
<P>
The most common ceremony for a destination wedding in Ghana is a Customary(Symbolic) ceremony. This is a great option for couples who want the beauty of a destination wedding but not the legalities that come along with it. Symbolic ceremonies allow you to have a more intimate ceremony and personalize your vows to create the wedding of your dreams. Choosing a symbolic ceremony for your destination wedding means you can incorporate personal elements such as unity candles or sand ceremonies. You can also choose to include any traditions that are important to you, whether they are religious or cultural. These types of ceremonies are not legally binding which means they can be performed by an officiant such as a friend or family member.

<p>
I am sure you are wondering, "if it's not legally binding, then are we even married?" The answer is simple- before your go to Ghana for your wedding, you and your partner will actually get legally married in your hometown at the courthouse or by an ordained minister at the location of your choice. Don't worry, no one even has to know about it if you don't want them to! Your anniversary date can be celebrated as the one in Mexico since that is when your marriage ceremony took place. As your travel agent, I will make sure that you understand what you need to do before you head to Mexico to make sure you're legally married. I've got your back! Overall, having a Customary (symbolic) ceremony is the most stress-free option since there are no legal documents or procedures required.
